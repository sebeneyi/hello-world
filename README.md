# hello-world

This is just to get the hang of GitHub. Honestly, it is still very hard to get used to but I think I know the code.
Branch out when you want to make changes, but not affect everything (aka main).
Then merge when you are done (with testing) if you want to keep it.
Commits are saves.

I made these changes on my local computer!
I also made a branch... How? idk
